            <p>I'm currently really interested in the applications of tech in the music and education industries. I'm interested in the personalization of software because I think software exists so that we can provide users with otherwise unattainable resources. By "personalized software" I mean software that's specific to a person or a group of people--creating products with a specific type of user in mind. And, I'm interested in encouraging women in tech!</p>
