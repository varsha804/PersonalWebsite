            <p>I'm currently really interested in the applications of tech in the music and education industries.<br>I'm interested in the personalization of software because I think software exists so that we can<br>provide users with otherwise unattainable resources. I'm interested in shaping user experience<br>since not every product feature makes sense to every user. And, I'm interested in encouraging<br>women in tech!</p>
